        <p> My name is Chanel Tiana Cruz. I am a freshman at Woodbury University, and I am enrolled in Applied Computer Science program. With this major, I want to be hands-on in analyzing and ensuring the safety of intelligent retrieval products for my generation and future generations. I hope to hone my skills and experiment with similar ideas to help solve human challenges through educational and professional experiences. This way, I am able to challenge myself, which will hopefully benefit the future; thus, I will be able to create and design innovative products and systems that will improve the quality of human life. </p>
